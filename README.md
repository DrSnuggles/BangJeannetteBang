# Jeannette Bang
Bang Jeannettes head to the beat

## Coding Steps
- Because of positioning in video is not very nice, i had to copy from HTML VIDEO source to CANVAS frame by frame = Frameserver, caching all frames => just for short loops
- When hovered we display the frame. Top = 0, Bottom = Last
- use one TAG with attributes instead of multiple for easy reuse
- take care of mem... at least i tried, js does :)

## Next Steps
- detect beat, heavy metal is not that easy to detect...
- score movement, extreme (max/min or bottom/top) should match beat withing given timeframe
